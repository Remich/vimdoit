# NOTES

- every action in the scheduled-directory (./todo) should be be a task
	- notes and everything else will be ignored when calculating backlog-/scheduled items
- dates will only be expanded when they are specifically being grepped for
	- filtering won't expand dates
- it is advised to copy expanded dates from the quickfix list into the actual projects
